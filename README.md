# Covid-TimeSeriesAnalysis

## Intro
This repository contains a time series analysis of covid cases in the United State from February 20200 and October 2020. All analysis was performed in a Jupyter Notebook. The goal of the analysis was to find trends for Covid cases by each state as well as compare the top 3 states with the highest covid cases (Texas, California, and Florida)

## Key Findings
The time series analysis of new cases for the top 3 states surprisingly followed the same trend of increasing cases as well as decreases with the exception of Texas having a huge spike in October. The rolling weekly average followed the trend of total new cases for the U.S. but provides a smoother depiction without the major fluctuations in values.
